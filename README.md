# Nursing Home Database

This project evolved from a school project I completed in my last semester. We were required to create a model for a relational database based on a provided example business. The example I chose was for a nursing home called Happy Endings Nursing Home. The project required us to track several details including residents, doctors, relatives, medications, etc. I also had to track certain specific qualities of the residents such as dementia, incontinence, fall related injuries, etc. 

In this repository I have included a screenshot showing the model I made of this database and a word document in which I go into further detail about the choices I made while creating this model. I have also included the code necessary to build this database in SQL.
